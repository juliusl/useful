# Julius's List of Useful Things He's Spent Time Figuring Out

1. In Windows, `forfiles /s /m *.txt /c "cmd /c copy /v @path c:\dest\@file"` This bad boy will search recursively (starting in the directory you ar currently in) for all files that match *.txt and copy it to a directory under c:\dest. @path is the path to the file found and @file is the name of the file with extension. Got this from (http://ss64.com/nt/forfiles.html)[http://ss64.com/nt/forfiles.html], but took a lot of tinkering to get it right. Could be used to do the super cool spy stuff, or even run as a script to auto backup your drives, or cleanup old files. Linux version might be `find / -name *.txt -exec "cp {} /home/dest/"` but I hadn't had a chance to test it.
